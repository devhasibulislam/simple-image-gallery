   - Allow users to select multiple images and delete them.
   - Provide a clear visual indication of selected images.
4. **Setting Feature Image:**
   - Allow users to set a feature image by sorting.
   - Pretend the first image (from the LTR direction) as the featured image
   - The feature image should be visually distinct from the other images.
5. **User Experience:**
   - Ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.
   - Implement transitions or animations for a polished look and feel.
6. **Live Demo:**
